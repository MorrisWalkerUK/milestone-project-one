# Provide Home Solutions Website 
## Milestone Project 1 - Static Front-End Website

<h2 align="center"><img src=" assets/img/readme-provide-home-page.png"></h2>


* Provide Home Solutions web site is a re-imagining of an old commercial web site based in Hereford, UK.  The aim of the Provide Home Solutions website is to appeal mostly to new commercial and domestic prospects.  It also will serve as reference point for existing customers who need to remember contact details or who wish to recommend interested parties to.  The website is designed to be responsive so that it is user-friendly and looks appealing on any device.

* This is my Milestone Project 1 submission for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development course. My website features three pages and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML and CSS.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

- A simple and refined colour scheme has been used. A white background has been used to not detract from the imagery. 


### Typography

- Headings are in Oswald and normal text is in Lato. Oswald is an easy-to-read font which adds character to the website. Lato is a clean and easily readable font frequently used for websites and applications. Sans serif is the fallback font in case the font cannot be imported into the site correctly.

### Imagery

- Imagery is a very important feature of the website, as the website needs to appeal visually to users and represent the Provide Solutions in a good light. 

- The pages feature slightly different image layouts, due to the type of images that need to be displayed. The home page features a clear picture of work at its best.  When describing the types of service an image of a construction site is used in the background in a subtle manner.

### Icons
- I used icons from Font Awesome to create a modern feel to the website.


## Structure

### Information Architecture
- The website has a Homepage, and then 2 further pages, Gallery and Contact.
    - Homepage - Landing page with brief descriptions and links out to the other pages.
    - Gallery - Provides examples of the different types of work undertaken
    - Contact - Provides a contact form

- I decided to keep a long scroll page for the home page to keep it clean and concise rather than introduce further landing pages to reduce the number of clicks the user needs to make to find information.

### Navigation Bar
- Each page features the navbar, allowing the user to easily navigate between them without needing to go back to the homepage.

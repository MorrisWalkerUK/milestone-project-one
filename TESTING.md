No issues arose during browser testing. CSS transitions worked on all browsers tested.

Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were largely consistent across browsers and devices. Exceptions include:

- The Lato font appearance changes quite a lot on mobile and iPad compared to desktop. I researched this and found this is a common experience.

  - The design aims to be suitable for both a commercial and domestic enquiries.

# Bugs

## Resolved

I have been a programmer for more than 10 years in my early career. I was carefully testing as I went. I did not realise until the end that I should have been recording problems encountered. I would describe my problems as minor and were nearly all fixed by a syntax correction.

When I had some difficulty, I would spend 1-2 hours researching the problem, looking at examples on the internet and finally I would contact the Code Institute student support facility. All issues raised were resolved by the student support team.

# Browser Compatibility

The site was tested in Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox on desktop.

The site was tested in Google Chrome and Safari on mobile and tablet.

No issues arose during browser testing. CSS transitions worked on all browsers tested. 

Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were largely consistent across browsers and devices. Exceptions include:
- Image stretching on Ipad (see Resolved Bugs)
- The Lato font appearance changes quite a lot on mobile and iPad compared to desktop. I researched this and found this is a common experience. 


# Testing User Stories


### Prospective Visitors

*These are users considering new property builds, improvements to existing property or need maintenance to an existing property.  They can be from a commercial or domestic perspective.
-	The design aims to be suitable for both a commercial or domestic enquiry.  The trust elements are common to both prospects and a high level list of services are shown at the bottom of the home page.  If the site was to be launched to the world then I expect there would be another layer of pages to be more specific about each service area.

* As a prospective visitor I would like to see the services available. 
-	the home page focuses on the key messages of trust and key services.  The design was kept clean and uncluttered to ensure the marketing messages are visible and easy to read.

-	A gallery of examples are available for prospects to view.  Then it is made easy to contact the business either by phone or email.

* As a prospective visitor I would like to be able to contact the business if I have any questions.
-	The contact details aim to make it as easy as possible to contact the business.  Direct phone numbers are provided.  The aim is to give a fast response to any enquiry.

# Peer Review

In the final stages of the project, I submitted the site for Peer Review by fellow students and alumni at Code Institute via Slack. Feedback included adding more text to the Homepage sections and making the 'Back to Top' button visible on all screen sizes, not just smaller devices. Both of these points were resolved. 

I also asked a number of friends both inside and outside of the Code Institute community for feedback on my project. The feedback on the website and documentation was positive It was suggested that I add a 404.html page which I have.

It was also suggested that I could remove the Homepage link from the Navigation bar as the logo is linked back to the Homepage, and also give my Github Repository a name that is more reflective of the website name and purpose. I decided not to change these as it felt like too late in the project, but it is something I will remember for future projects.

# Bugs

## Resolved

I have been a programmer for more than 10 years in my early career.  I was carefully testing as I went.  I did not realise until the end that I should have been recording problems encountered.  I would describe my problems as minor and were nearly all fixed by a syntax correction.

When I had some difficulty, I would spend 1-2 hours researching the problem, looking at examples on the internet and finally I would contact the Code Institute student support facility. All issues raised were resolved by the student support team.
